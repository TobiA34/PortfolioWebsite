                  <p>In this unit, I will be learning how to program. For example, in the first year, I will be learning the basics of programming such as variables, loops if statements and procedures.  The program that I will be using to code is processing and each week I will be doing different exercises to improve my coding skills.</p>

I also created a procedure called noughts which has the course stored inside. Then i have created a procedure called setup and inside this i have called the procedure so that the grid and noughts can be drawn.</p>

                   <p>I feel like programming is fun because there is a lot of problem solving involved in this course and I like a challenge for example week 1 when I had to draw a stickman was really fun to do. I had to break the solution into small steps before bringing the whole stick man together. I think this course was a bit difficult at the start but as the weeks progressed then it started to become easier to do.  I feel like I will learn a lot from this course in the end which I can apply in the workplace.</p>
