                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p>My name is Tobi Adegoroye, I am 18 years old and my birthday is 18/04/2000.  I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an amazing experience. I am from Manchester and I have lived here all my life. I am half English and half Nigerian and I am a undergraduate student at Manchester metropolitan university. The course that I am studying at this university is software engineering and I think this is a perfect choice. In my spare time I like playing video games, play football, watching the latest movies in my spare time and cooking which helps me to relax after a stressful day doing work. I have gained some achievements while I was in college for example in form, I helped raised Â£250 to the Congo appeal and I have achieved various medals from sporting events. </p>

                  <h2>Why I have chosen this course</h2>
                  <article id="ChosenCourse">
                     <p>One of the main reasons why I chose software engineering is because I want to become an iOS App developer and hopefully create a app as big as snapchat. I also think that this course will teach me how to use a database properly and I can integrate it in my apps in the future. This will help me store data and it will help with other stuff in the future. I also think this course will help me have a better understanding of how programs work by using different programming structures.</p>
